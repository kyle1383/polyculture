# Polyculture 
A research project performed with the UVM Morphology Evolution and Cognition Lab.

## The Problem 
Monocultures are a problem in all sorts of domains. If a large crop of corn is identical, a single virus can cause massive damage. This type of problem extends to the domain of robotics as well. If a fleet of autonomous cars all share identical software, malicious software could take down the entire fleet.
