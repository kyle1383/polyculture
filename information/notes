BIG CHECKS 
    • seed is updated enough that random numbers are always differt but not more 
    • Evolution is occuring 
    • AFPO is functioning properly (RAINBOW WATERFALL) 
    • Make sure any time a copy, change or mutation takes place that it actually happens 
    • comments are thorough and descriptive 


do robots each have an age right? 
always adjust robot before appending it to population 
there is potential for an infinite loop somewhere in evolve 



seems that for whatever reason there aren't always mutations occuring

Find way to have a Variable that changes all the constants

This is where we had that problem of how it feels like comparing 1 robot to 10 

Also what is meaning of Uh Oh.


DEBUG 2/24
When defining population we specify seed, is it updated?

When evolving there is a data variable, which appears not to be intialized empty, I think this is just how numpy does it?
update seed when evolving. Is this needed?

Evolution begins to get complicated.
WHen I change population size I get an INdex error: is there a fixed value somewhere?
######infinite loop########
The reason is that sometimes, after afpo there are more then 30(population size) robots which are the same and have the highest fitness.
This is most likely a seed problem right?

when we pause at 61 a chart pops up, why?

The rainbow waterfall seems to go down sometimes, it never should right?

#3/21 
maybe eliminate the object/joint because I think it is causing the boom ba boom ba boom ba bang!
